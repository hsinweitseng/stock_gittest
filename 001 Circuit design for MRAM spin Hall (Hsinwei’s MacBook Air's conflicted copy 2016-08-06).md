Spin hall high density array design with circuit

Hsin-wei Tseng, Jongyeon Kim, Pei-feng

### Design concept and drawing

- Using spin Hall device to reduce device layout area for embedded memory cache application. 
- Due to external transistor size, additional area is needed. More  embedded high density NVM memory is needed. 
- future neuro-network-based.
