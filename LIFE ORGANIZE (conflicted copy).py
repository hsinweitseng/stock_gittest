## Casual writing

	I would like to know how my mind process those information acquire from external source. I don't really understand how to fully take the advantage of the smart phone and with information gathering power. For example, good news about gold and bad news about good when. I don't know how to fully take advantage of utilize the effects of large information gathering. Bulsdiclaly thisnis just to write to think. And it become really importat now that I will need to be able to write a lots of text to enable myself to focus. Or to execute my goal.bfeel writing is important. However, it is not easy every time that I could get to understand the feeling infusing thh computer. 
	
	
	
	
## Three different level of thinking 

	There are three different level of thinking. The basic thinking is reflective thinking without any processing or any thought. Second is basic thinking from reading or learning to utilize other persons ideas of thinking. And utilize. Third time level of thinking is critical thinking to crtitize or analyze the ideas or thought from other person. 

## Political movement

	politics movement to learn how to organize my life and take care of all resources. It is a difficult to fully understand how to make everything working for your need. So that, we will not be able to achieve our goal, but keeping bouncing back and forward from many different person.
	
## What DO I want to achieve

    Large cumulative of wealth for the family to ge able to enjoy the time together.
    
## When you got confused and feel really busy. Plz STOP and RELAX

    Sometimes, we got too busy and we cannot relax and enjoy our life and time.

## 爸爸的信

爸爸很希望能有空好好寫下要給你們的信。也希望自己有一天，能把自己的想法和好的經驗傳給你們。不過，自己你們出生以來，家裡的事情也忙，也多，也沒有時間做下來好好想想，寫下要給你們的東西。總是東一個西一個的，沒有有什麼來頭的寫下一些有的沒有的事。

### How to enjoying your life

- First, you need to know how to enjoy yourself along when you have time and money. That is something I don't know. Because I never know how to stay peaceful with my own. That is difficult. 
1. Relax and deep breath will help you relax. 
2. [text to link](http://example.com/)
3. Watch a nice movie. 
4. Drunk a coffee latte. 
5. Boba tea. 
6. Pho 
7. Tomato beef noodle soup. 
8. Heating blanket
9. Back stretch
10. Back revolution 
11. Cool down
12. Enjoy the life. And understand what you like. Back. 
13. Enjoy the companion. Relaxing conversation.
